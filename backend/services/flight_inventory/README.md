Here's how you could structure your search flight microservice file directory, considering its interaction with the flight inventory service:

Explanation of Changes

models:
search_request.py: Defines a model representing the user's search input (origin, destination, dates, etc.).
flight.py: Defines a model representing flight data retrieved from the inventory service.

services:
flight_inventory_client.py: Contains the logic to communicate with the flight inventory service. Handles API calls or messaging patterns, request/response transformations.

routes:
search_api.py: Defines your API endpoints (e.g., /search) that handle incoming search requests, interact with the flight_inventory_client, and format the results.
Example: Part of app/services/flight_inventory_client.py

Python
import requests  # Assuming the inventory service has a REST API

class FlightInventoryClient:
def __init__(self, inventory_service_url):
self.base_url = inventory_service_url

    def search_flights(self, search_request):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/flights/search"
        response = requests.post(url, json=search_request.to_dict()) 
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.json()
        else:
            raise Exception("Error from Inventory Service")  # Error handling
Use code with caution.
Key Considerations

Communication Protocol: The flight_inventory_client.py assumes the inventory service has a REST API. Adapt if it uses messaging (RabbitMQ, etc.).
Data Mapping: You'll likely need some mapping between the search input, the format expected by the inventory service, and the response format you provide to users.
Error Handling & Resilience: Implement retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, etc., to make your search service robust to failures in the inventory service.
Advantages of This Approach

Clear Separation: Isolates the interaction with the external inventory service in the 'services' layer.
Focused Models: Specific models representing user input and flight data.
Testability: You can easily unit test your client and routes independently. Consider mocking the flight_inventory_client during testing.
